> A Tiger? Richard Parker was a Tiger?
> Yeah! He got his name through a clerical error. A Hunter caught him when drinking from a
> stream when he was a cub, and named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold
> him to our zoo, but the names got switched on the paperwork. The hunter was listed as 
> Thirsty and the tiger was called Richard Parker. We laughed about it and the name stuck.
